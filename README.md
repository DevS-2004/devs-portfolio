## 📌 About Me

I’m Devendra Singh, a pre-final year student at **Dr. B.R. Ambedkar National Institute of Technology, Jalandhar (NITJ)**, pursuing **B.Tech in Information Technology**.

With strong experience in the **MERN stack**, I love building responsive, scalable applications. I’m also exploring AI integration in modern web apps (like Gemini API) and enjoy contributing to open-source when time allows.

## 🧠 Inspiration & Learning

This portfolio was built with reference to real-world portfolios, GitHub inspirations, and my own design ideas. I’ve used this to practice:

- ✅ Clean code structuring  
- ✅ Component-based architecture  
- ✅ AI/ML API usage  
- ✅ UI/UX consistency

> **“Consistency beats intensity.” — I build every day, learn every day.**
